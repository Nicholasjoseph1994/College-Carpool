Put ideas of things to add here:
	Sort Rides
	Get Referral Money from Venmo (Might be possible to just email them and ask about this if its not in the API)
	Possibly make an option to pay with that square thing that looked very easy if you aren't connected to Venmo
	Delete Old Rides, or potentially make a history page to show them
	Possibly get the autocompleting location text boxes google maps has
	We should really have some form of authentication that actually works (we have some cookie stuff but I think we need to check cookies on every page and redirect back to the main page if the cookie doesnt exist)

Minor Things:
	Put some verification into the Post Ride form so that we catch for poorly formatted dates/times instead of throwing an error
	We can add some more google maps information to the rides page (distance of trip, estimated time) 


Glitches (basically any thing that causes a server crash):
	Negative Dates cause a crash
	submitting an empty form for Post Ride gives errors
	cost 0 wasn't working at the hackathon, we should make sure that is possible

Questions:
	Who actually needs to be logged into Venmo? If I ask someone to join their ride, then log out completely, and then they accept, can I still be charged?
