Put ideas of things to add here:
	Sort Rides
	Get Referral Money from Venmo (Might be possible to just email them and ask about this if its not in the API)
	Possibly make an option to pay with that square thing that looked very easy if you aren't connected to Venmo
	Delete Old Rides, or potentially make a history page to show them



Minor Things:
	Put some verification into the Post Ride form so that we catch for poorly formatted dates/times instead of throwing an error
